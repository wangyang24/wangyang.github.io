Biography
=====
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at Dalian University of Technology, working under the guidance of Pro. [Xin Yang](https://xinyangdut.github.io/). From 2023.11 and now, I was a visiting student at HLT Lab, National University of Singapore, Singapore, and supervised by Pro. [Haizhou Li](https://www.colips.org/~eleliha/). My main research interest focus on brain-inspired computation based on spiking neural network (SNN), including but not limited to multi-scale plasticity and multi-modal integration in SNN. Besides, my early
work were on adversarial robustness and scene confusing-discovery.
